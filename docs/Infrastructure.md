# Infrastructure

## Local

We implemented a local infrastructure as code for contributers and us to simulate what the TerraZen ecosystem looks like online and to have an easy option to build and develop locally.

We build the local infrastructure with Docker and Docker-Compose to make it easy to use.

For now we got an docker-compose file for every stage that we would typically deploy on our test systems and that the contributers/customers could possibly deploy on their systems if they want.

We build a DEV, UAT and PROD stage each with a certain config for each application to be appropriate for the respective stage.
